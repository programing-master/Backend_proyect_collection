# Authentication with Django REST Framework and TokenAuthentication

This project implements an authentication system using Django REST Framework (DRF) and TokenAuthentication.

## Description

Token authentication is a method where each user receives a unique token that must be presented in every request to access protected resources. This method is ideal for client-server applications, such as mobile apps or single-page applications (SPA).
